# ChoreografWebApp
[!NOTE]
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.1.

 I developed a customized and resposive website in 3 languages for a client offering choreography services for events and wedding dance coaching. The frontend deployed on Vercel was built with Angular and Tailwind CSS, while the backend includes a Gmail mailing API using ASP.NET which is accessed through an Angular Reactive Form, deployed on Heroku via the Github pipeline.
